# Census Income Study - Andrew Graham

## Project Summary

Andrew Graham's 'Census Income Study' is an extensive data science project focused on the analysis of census data. Utilizing a range of techniques from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis to advanced statistical modeling, the project aims to uncover patterns and derive predictive insights from census data. Key areas of focus include clustering analysis to identify data patterns and logistic regression for predictive modeling.

## Conclusions

The project successfully demonstrates the application of various data science techniques to real-world census data. Through meticulous data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and clustering, significant patterns were identified. The logistic regression model further provided valuable predictive insights, showcasing the potential of data science in socio-economic studies.
